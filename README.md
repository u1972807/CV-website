Target user profile:

The user profile this website is targeted to are enterprises looking to hire a computer scientist.
While the website contains all the information needed to express my description it is not overwelming nor excesive.
It intends to be short and simple but interesting enough to captivate your atention, not only in the textual self-portrait,
but also by the design of the website, since the target is looking for a computer scientist he may require the ability to make a good looking website,
so it has to check both boxes.

Information architecture:

The website arquitecture is simple, inside the directory httpdocs there are the pages of the website, the main page, index.html,
and another 4 pages to navigate through the website, this folder also contains a subfolder named style,
which includes the style.css and all the images used in the project.

Inside the code the structure is simple too, we have the header, which includes the title and the menu, after this we have the sidebar, which contains contact information,
after that there is the content, which is the main container of information, aftr that we have the footer. Inside the code this sections are comented to simplify navigation.
All these sections are nourished with div's and their id's and class', for which will be used in the style.css which gives the style to the project.

Visual design:

The intention of this website was to condense the most information in the least amount of space, but without it being overwelming. So we start with a big spacy header,
with a simple navigation bar, on the right we have the sidebar with a border so contact information is always visible, but doesent inferfeer with the experience,
the footer is inteded to imediatly show that the page has ended, the color is the oposite to the rest so you imediatly know that.
In general the palet of colours is light, so its pleasing to the eye, but the important elements such as the navigation bar are highlighted so you never loose track of it.
